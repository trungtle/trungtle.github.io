<img width=128px src="{% link /assets/images/self_drawing.jpg %}" alt="self drawing" style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;"> Hi there, I am a computer graphics / video games software engineer. Dabbler in rendering, ML, game design, and occasionally homebrewing table top stories ⚔️. 


Previously, I worked on neural rendering research at Google [Stadia R&D](https://stadia.dev/) and also AI performance for [Red Dead Redepmtion 2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/) at [Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/).

I recently resleased the [SyntheticFur dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/synthetic-fur) in collaboration with Google Brain and Stadia.

You can browse the sidebar for some of the things I that have worked on.

## Work
#### GRAPHICS ENGINEER, DEVIATION - MAY 2021 - Present
TBA

#### ML ENGINEER, GOOGLE STADIA - OCT 2019 - MAY 2021

Advocated for and applied neural rendering research toward solving real-time graphics problems for video games. My focuses were AI art generation and high fidelity fur rendering. Worked on generating custom 3D datasets using Houdini and Blender, training generative machine learning models with Google infrastructure, parameter tuning, and interfacing novel workflows with artists. 

#### AI PROGRAMMER, ROCKSTAR GAMES - 2017 - 2019

Analyzed and optimized performance for AI systems in Red Dead Redemption II, Rockstar’s premier narrative-driven, open world video game title with deep AI interactions.  Specifically worked to improve  the C++ game code for LOD management of AI physics, weapon and combat systems, transport systems, and pathfinding systems for PS4 and XBox. Worked on general AI and animation optimization for several specific scripted in-game missions as well as miscellaneous performance bugs in the final weeks before release. 

#### TOOLS PROGRAMMER INTERN, EPIC GAMES - 2016

Implemented VR editing tools for Unreal Engine 4. The tools include terrain editing, virtual keyboards, and foliage painting for level editing. These tools were introduced in the Unreal 4.13 and 4.14 updates.

#### FIRMWARE ENGINEER, JAWBONE — 2012-2014

Developed infrastructure and applications for the UP3 fitness wristband on ARM Cortex and iOS platforms. This included the BTLE protocol, authentication and encryption between devices and the mobile app, activity classification collection tools, peripheral drivers, USB interface, and UX.

#### RESEARCH ASSISTANT, UW SENSOR LAB+INTEL LAB — 2010-2012

Designed a GUI with Python QT for the systems used in Wireless Resonant Energy Link (WREL) research. The software supports data collection, data visualization, wireless control, and power diagnostics. Over the years, this software has been extended for use at the startup company [Wibotic](https://www.wibotic.com/) and in other research ventures.
