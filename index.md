<img width=128px src="{% link /assets/images/self_drawing.jpg %}" alt="self drawing" style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;"> Hi there, I am a computer graphics / video games software engineer. Dabbler in rendering, ML, game design, and occasionally homebrewing table top stories ⚔️. 


Previously I was an AI programmer on [Red Dead Redepmtion 2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/) by [Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/). Currenlty, I'm working on graphics research at [Stadia](https://stadia.dev/).

You can browse the sidebar for some of the things I that have worked on.
