Hi there! I'm a graphics programmer at [Bad Robot Games](https://www.badrobotgames.com/), working on rendering performance and features for a new unannounced title at the studio.

Previously, at [Deviation Games](https://www.deviationgames.com/), I worked on custom rendering features in Unreal Engine 5, such as signed distance field raymarching, portal rendering, and GPU tessellation.

At Google [Stadia R&D](https://stadia.dev/), I worked on neural rendering research for fur rendering, and   released the [SyntheticFur dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/synthetic-fur) in collaboration with Google Brain and Stadia.

At [Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/), I worked as an AI engineer to optimize physics and animation performance for [Red Dead Redepmtion 2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/).

I enjoy dabbling in digital painting and VFX using Houdini. The thing that got my so interested in graphics is its hybrid nature between technical code and aesthetic visuals.

## Work
#### SERNIOR GRAPHICS ENGINEER, [BAD ROBOT GAMES](https://www.badrobotgames.com/) - JAN 2024 - Present
Graphics engineer on an unannounced title.


#### GRAPHICS ENGINEER, [DEVIATION GAMES](https://www.deviationgames.com/) - MAY 2021 - JAN 2024
Worked on various rendering features in Unreal Engine 5, such as real-time signed distance field ray marching, portal rendering, and GPU tessellation.

#### ML ENGINEER, GOOGLE STADIA - OCT 2019 - MAY 2021

Advocated for and applied neural rendering research toward solving real-time graphics problems for video games. My focuses were AI art generation and high fidelity fur rendering. Worked on generating custom 3D datasets using Houdini and Blender, training generative machine learning models with Google infrastructure, parameter tuning, and interfacing novel workflows with artists.

#### AI PROGRAMMER, [ROCKSTAR GAMES](https://www.rockstargames.com/) - 2017 - 2019

Analyzed and optimized performance for AI systems in Red Dead Redemption II, Rockstar’s premier narrative-driven, open world video game title with deep AI interactions.  Specifically worked to improve  the C++ game code for LOD management of AI physics, weapon and combat systems, transport systems, and pathfinding systems for PS4 and XBox. Worked on general AI and animation optimization for several specific scripted in-game missions as well as miscellaneous performance bugs in the final weeks before release.

#### TOOLS PROGRAMMER INTERN, EPIC GAMES - 2016

Implemented VR editing tools for Unreal Engine 4. The tools include terrain editing, virtual keyboards, and foliage painting for level editing. These tools were introduced in the Unreal 4.13 and 4.14 updates.

#### FIRMWARE ENGINEER, JAWBONE — 2012-2014

Developed infrastructure and applications for the UP3 fitness wristband on ARM Cortex and iOS platforms. This included the BTLE protocol, authentication and encryption between devices and the mobile app, activity classification collection tools, peripheral drivers, USB interface, and UX.

#### RESEARCH ASSISTANT, UW SENSOR LAB+INTEL LAB — 2010-2012

Designed a GUI with Python QT for the systems used in Wireless Resonant Energy Link (WREL) research. The software supports data collection, data visualization, wireless control, and power diagnostics. Over the years, this software has been extended for use at the startup company [Wibotic](https://www.wibotic.com/) and in other research ventures.
